# Probabilistic_Learning_Predictive_Coding
This MATLAB code is used to study models in the predictive coding framework on a probabilistic task (see Bogacz 2017, 'A Tutorial on the Free-Energy...')

The files included here are:

ExpProb.m
This function implements the explicit probabilistic model.

ExpReg.m
This function implements the explicit regression model.

CovM.m
This function implements the common variable model.

Common.m
This function implements the common variable model.

Model_recovery.m
This function simulates noisy data generated by each of the four models, then attempts model recovery.

Linear_Regression_Comparison.m
This function compares the performance of the four models to a simple linear regression.

Optimise.m
This function is used to optimise the learning rates of the models.
